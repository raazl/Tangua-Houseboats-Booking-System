        content: `
            <p>Tangua Haor transforms with the seasons, each offering a unique charm. Choosing the best time to visit depends on your preferences and what you wish to experience:</p>
            <h3>Monsoon (June to September):</h3>
            <p>During the monsoon season, the haor is at its fullest, with vast expanses of water creating a mesmerizing landscape. This is the ideal time for cruising and exploring the submerged villages. The lush greenery and vibrant ecosystem are at their peak, offering incredible opportunities for nature photography.</p>
            <h3>Post-Monsoon (October to November):</h3>
            <p>The water levels gradually recede, revealing new landscapes and making it easier to explore the surrounding areas. The weather is pleasant, and the migratory birds begin to arrive, making it a great time for birdwatching.</p>
            <h3>Winter (December to February):</h3>
            <p>Winter brings cooler temperatures and a clear sky, perfect for enjoying the tranquility of the haor. This is also the peak season for migratory birds, with thousands of species flocking to the wetlands. It's an excellent time for birdwatching and enjoying the crisp air.</p>
            <p>While Tangua Haor offers beauty year-round, the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons are generally considered the best for a houseboat experience, offering the most immersive and picturesque journey.</p>
